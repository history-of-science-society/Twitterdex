## What is a Twitterdex?
"Twitterdex" is a portmanteau of "Twitter" and "Rolodex," of which only the later needs explaining! Rolodex, itself a portmanteau of "rolling" and "index," refers to a rotating set of cards used to store contact information IRL. The Twitterdex, then, is an online directory of Twitter users. In this case, these are historians of science and related fields like medicine and technology.
