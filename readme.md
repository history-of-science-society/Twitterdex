## What is a Twitterdex?
"Twitterdex" is a portmanteau of "Twitter" and "Rolodex," of which only the later needs explaining! Rolodex, itself a portmanteau of "rolling" and "index," refers to a rotating set of cards used to store contact information IRL. The skeuomorphic design of the digital version harkens back to this history by including the holes that would have been used to include the cards on a stand.

In short, the Twitterdex is an online directory of Twitter users. In this case, these are historians of science and related fields like medicine and technology.

## What Does This Code Do?
The code uses Node.js to fetch and parse data from the Formstack and Twitter APIs to render a Handlebars template to HTML. A live version of the finished product is avaialable on the [History of Science Society's website](https://hssonline.formstack.com/forms/twitterdex).
